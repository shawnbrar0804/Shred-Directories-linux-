# Shred Directories (linux)
shred directories now

shred is a linux command which is able to shred only files. It cannot take directory as an input. However, I have prepared a R Script which you can use to shred even directories. I am not very well versed in bash, hence, I have not created a bash script. 

Use the script shred_directories.r
